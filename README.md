## Bloom Filter

This is code for implementation of the Bloom Filter data structure.

You can read about how it works here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter

I did not implement methods to test for false-positive cases

Instead of keeping the numbers of hashing methods abstract, I limited it to 3

# Pseudo-code

The first thing I did was create a Design Doc with pseudocode so that I could easily change and alter ideas before actually coding

# Implementation

Implemented data structure in BloomFilter.java

# Testing

Created a Test Doc to keep track of cases I had to test for

Wrote test cases in BloomFilterTest.java
